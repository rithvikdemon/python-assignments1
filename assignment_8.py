# question 1

#We represent time in a way that’s easy for us to understand. However, Python stores it in tuples. These python tuples are
#made of nine numbers. Leap seconds are added to make up to Earth’s slowing rotation. When DST is 0, it isn’t applied.
#When it’s 1, it is applied. However, when it is -1, it is up to the library to determine that.
#This tuple has an equivalent struct_time structure
